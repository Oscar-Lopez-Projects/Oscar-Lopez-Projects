### Hi there, I'm Oscar! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack web developer who recently graduated from Lambda with a desire to concentrate on front-end development. I have worked with a couple of cross-functional teans in creating web application. I have played the roles of UI\UX designer, Front-end Developer, and Back-end Developer.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Iâ€™m currently working on working creating a functional application for my mom's jello cake business called Modesto Jello Cakes.
- I'm very passionate about powerlifting and working out. In the future I plan on creating a fitness app!
- Currently I'm studying algorithms in order to be fully prepare for interview within the coming weeks!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge lakers fan
